        "##1. What is a parameter?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A parameter is a value learned by a machine learning model during training. It controls how the model behaves and helps make predictions. Examples include weights in linear regression or neurons in a neural network. Parameters are updated repeatedly to reduce error.\n",
        "\n",
        "##2. What is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It tells us how changes in one variable relate to changes in another. A correlation value is between –1 and +1. A positive value shows both increase together, while a negative value shows an opposite movement.\n",
        "\n",
        "##3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Negative correlation means that when one variable increases, the other variable decreases. It shows an inverse relationship. For example, as outside temperature increases, heater usage decreases. A value close to –1 indicates a strong negative correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "##4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Machine Learning is a process where computers learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. The main components are the dataset, features, model, loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics. These work together to train and improve the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "##5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Loss value shows how far the model’s predictions are from the actual values. A high loss means the model is performing poorly, while a low loss shows good performance. During training, the model tries to reduce this loss. It is one of the most important indicators of model accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "##6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Continuous variables are numeric values that can take an infinite range, such as height, weight, or temperature. Categorical variables represent groups or categories such as gender, city, or car model. They require special encoding in machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "##7. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Categorical variables must be converted to numbers before training a model. Common techniques include Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, and Target Encoding. These methods allow ML algorithms to interpret category-based information.\n",
        "\n",
        "##8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Training data is used to teach the model and help it learn patterns. Testing data is unseen data used to check how well the model performs on new information. This separation avoids overfitting and gives a fair accuracy estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "##9. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "- sklearn.preprocessing is a module in Scikit-Learn that contains functions for transforming and preparing data. It includes tools for scaling, encoding, normalization, and feature extraction. These transformations help the model learn better.\n",
        "\n",
        "##10. What is a Test set?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A test set is a portion of the dataset that is kept aside to evaluate the final model. It contains data the model has never seen before. The accuracy measured on the test set tells us how well the model performs on real-world unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "##11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- We use the train_test_split() function from Scikit-Learn. It divides the dataset into two parts: training and testing. Typically, 70–80% of the data is used for training, and the rest is used as the test set."
